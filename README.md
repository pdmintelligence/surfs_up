#Surfs up Challenge

**Overview**

The goal is to analyze temperature trends using data on temperatuer for the months of june and December in Oahu, HI. The ultimate goal is the determination of the viability for an ice cream shop.

Data was selected for the period covering 2010 to the present for the months under review (June and December). 

**Results**

* The table shows that 1700 instances of temperatures recorded in the month of June were used in the analysis. 
* The data shows that on average, during the past decade, the average temperature in the month of June was 74.94 Degrees F. 
* There was little variation in the average temperature during this month, such that the standard deviation was only 3.26 Degrees F.

#Summary 

The data shows that there is little variation in the average temperatures across the year at this location. On average, the location's temperature appears to be in the mid to lower 70s. This appears to indicate that the location will make a place fo the ice cream shop.

Additional analyses may include the following:
* Given that climate change results in increasingly variable temperatures, it may be advisable to query the data while filtering for temperature values that were recorded within the past 5 years rather than the past 10 years.
* Lastly, it may be advisable to perform the same type of analysis on additional locations in the region (IE: extend the scope of the temperature analysis to other locals rather than just Oahu, HI
